## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a data analyst/data engineer with a bachelors in Computer Science and a masters degree in Data Science.

Iâ€™m currently working on [lubrilog](https://github.com/arrismo/lubrilog) available on CRAN!

Currently analyzing surgical outcomes at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center using R and SQL.

Outside of work, I enjoy building data pipelines!
